### This is a temporary solution for School Planet (SP) in the form of a web application

# Advantages over the site:
- faster access
- fullscreen mode
- improved performance

# There is a minus, this application is only for Android.

# You can use my app as a mockup, it has everything set up and you just need to change the URL in the code
